Coordination between Cursor (lead IDE), Codex (isolated worker), and the human operator. Update this file after every material task per `.cursor/rules/02-coding-agent-workflow.mdc`.

## Latest handoff summary

**WP-02 — Supabase Schema Migration (migrations applied)** — All 6 migration files have been applied to the live Supabase project `iqoelotzvdcjifajfuto` (region: `ap-southeast-1`, Postgres 17.6, `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`) via the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool. All 26 MVP tables are confirmed live. `src/types/database.ts` has been replaced with a full auto-generated type file from `generate_typescript_types` (MCP). `embedding_chunks.embedding_vector vector(3072)` confirmed in live schema. RLS remains deferred to WP-03. pgvector ivfflat index applied. `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build` pass. WP-02 is **`ready_for_review`** (migrations live). Next packet: **WP-03 — Auth and Basic Access** on branch `dev/cursor-auth`.

Note: Supabase CLI `supabase link` and `supabase db push` require a personal access token (PAT) — not the publishable key. The direct DB host (`db.iqoelotzvdcjifajfuto.supabase.co`) is IPv6-only with no public IPv4 A record; direct TCP on port 5432 is unreachable from this machine. Migrations were applied via MCP. Operator should cycle provided credentials per earlier agreement.

## Reusable handoff template — Cursor

Copy and fill before starting work:

```markdown
## Handoff — Cursor

- **Date:**
- **Work packet:** (ID and title from `docs/implementation/05 Work Packet Register.md`)
- **Branch:** `dev/cursor-<task>` (must match packet)
- **Allowed paths:** (paste from packet)
- **Prohibited paths:** (paste from packet)
- **Sources read:** PROJECT_STATE.md, AGENT_HANDOFF.md, roadmap, packet register, packet-specific implementation doc(s)
- **Acceptance criteria:** (from packet)
- **Verification run:** (lint / typecheck / tests / manual checklist — or explicit “none yet”)
- **Outcome:** (done / blocked / partial)
- **Updates made:** PROJECT_STATE.md (Y/N), AGENT_HANDOFF.md (Y/N), other paths
```

## Reusable handoff template — Codex

Copy and fill before starting work:

```markdown
## Handoff — Codex

- **Date:**
- **Work packet:** (single packet ID — Codex is bounded to one packet)
- **Branch:** `dev/codex-<task>` or as specified in packet (must match packet)
- **Allowed paths:** (paste exactly from packet; do not expand scope)
- **Prohibited paths:** (paste exactly; includes `docs/lexos-system-spec/` unless human explicitly instructs)
- **Sources read:** (packet “Source Documents to Read” list)
- **Acceptance criteria:** (from packet)
- **Tests / verification:** (per packet; attach results or manual report)
- **Outcome:** (done / blocked — stop and report if packet requires prohibited files)
- **Handoff:** Append row to Handoff log; update PROJECT_STATE if phase/blockers/next step changed
```
