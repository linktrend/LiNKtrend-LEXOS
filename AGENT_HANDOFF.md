# LEXOS — Agent Handoff

Coordination between Cursor (lead IDE), Codex (isolated worker), and the human operator. Update this file after every material task per `.cursor/rules/02-coding-agent-workflow.mdc`.

---

## Latest handoff summary

WP-00 (Repository Control and State Files) populated root control files: `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, and set WP-00 to `ready_for_review` in `docs/implementation/05 Work Packet Register.md`. The repo remains in **Phase 0** with **no application scaffold** and **no Git metadata** until the operator initializes Git and remotes. Next implementation packet is **WP-01 — App Foundation** on branch **`dev/cursor-foundation`** (per register), after baseline commit workflow.

## Handoff log

| Date (UTC) | Agent / tool | Work packet | Summary |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| 2026-05-11 | Cursor | WP-00 | Established project state, handoff structure, README, env template, gitignore; WP-00 → `ready_for_review`. |

## Reusable handoff template — Cursor

Copy and fill before starting work:

```markdown
## Handoff — Cursor

- **Date:**
- **Work packet:** (ID and title from `docs/implementation/05 Work Packet Register.md`)
- **Branch:** `dev/cursor-<task>` (must match packet)
- **Allowed paths:** (paste from packet)
- **Prohibited paths:** (paste from packet)
- **Sources read:** PROJECT_STATE.md, AGENT_HANDOFF.md, roadmap, packet register, packet-specific implementation doc(s)
- **Acceptance criteria:** (from packet)
- **Verification run:** (lint / typecheck / tests / manual checklist — or explicit “none yet”)
- **Outcome:** (done / blocked / partial)
- **Updates made:** PROJECT_STATE.md (Y/N), AGENT_HANDOFF.md (Y/N), other paths
```

## Reusable handoff template — Codex

Copy and fill before starting work:

```markdown
## Handoff — Codex

- **Date:**
- **Work packet:** (single packet ID — Codex is bounded to one packet)
- **Branch:** `dev/codex-<task>` or as specified in packet (must match packet)
- **Allowed paths:** (paste exactly from packet; do not expand scope)
- **Prohibited paths:** (paste exactly; includes `docs/lexos-system-spec/` unless human explicitly instructs)
- **Sources read:** (packet “Source Documents to Read” list)
- **Acceptance criteria:** (from packet)
- **Tests / verification:** (per packet; attach results or manual report)
- **Outcome:** (done / blocked — stop and report if packet requires prohibited files)
- **Handoff:** Append row to Handoff log; update PROJECT_STATE if phase/blockers/next step changed
```
